```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Purpose

This is an example to test the new API for the UN's World Population Propects, described at
https://population.un.org/dataportal/about/dataapi.  This is not an exhaustive tutorial, just a single example. 

My personal preference is to skip the JSON formatting and to download in CSV format. The API uses a vertical bar | as the csv separator character, and csv files all seem to start with a line

>   sep =|

that will need to be skipped when converting to a tibble or data frame.    

### Initial Setup and Housekeeping

```{r housekeeping, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

base_url = 'https://population.un.org/dataportalapi/api/v1'
```

### Available Topics

We can get a list of "topics" like this
```{r topics}

target = paste0(base_url, '/topics/?format=csv')

df_topics = read.csv(target, sep='|', skip=1)

df_topics

```
Each topic has an id#, a full name, and a short name.  We'll try 2/Fertility/Fert and look at the available variables for that topic. 

### Indicators
```{r indicators}

target = paste0(base_url,'/indicators/?format=csv')

df_indicators = read.csv(target, sep='|', skip=1) %>% 
                   filter(TopicName == 'Fertility')

# what are the column names for the indicators info?
names(df_indicators)
```

The indicators have lots of detailed information in all of those columns, but the most interesting are the first few columns. Let's peek at those, plus the starting and ending years for the available data series.

```{r indicators2}

df_indicators %>% 
   select(Id:ShortName, SourceStartYear, SourceEndYear)

```

Let's try the single-year age-specific rates: the ID# for that variable is **68** and the short name is **ASFR1**.  Estimates are available from 1950 to 2100. 

### Locations

Before grabbing data for this variable, we'll need to select a population (or populations) for which we want the ASFRs. To see the available list we can use the API again:

```{r locations}

target = paste0(base_url, '/locations?sort=id&format=csv')

df_locations = read.csv(target, sep='|', skip=1)

# how many locations?

nrow(df_locations)

# print the first 20 observations
df_locations %>% 
  head(20)

# find the codes for India and Bangladesh

df_locations %>% 
   filter( Name %in% c('India','Bangladesh'))

```

### Retrieve a specific indicator for a selected country

Suppose we want to compare single-year fertility rates in India and Bangladesh during the 1990s. That is indicator 68 (ASFR1), for location IDs 50 (Bangladesh) and 356 (India). 

The URL for that specific query is the base_url + 

> /data/indicators/68/locations/50,356/start/1990/end/1999/?format=csv

Let's try it:
```{r get_data}

my_indicator = 68
my_location  = '50,356'
my_startyr   = 1990
my_endyr     = 1999

target = paste0(base_url,
                '/data/indicators/',my_indicator,
                '/locations/',my_location,
                '/start/',my_startyr,
                '/end/',my_endyr,
                '/?format=csv')

target

df_data = read.csv(target, sep='|', skip=1)

# look at the data's structure

dim(df_data)
names(df_data)

# peek at a random bit of the dataframe

df_data %>% 
  sample_n(size=20) %>% 
  select(Location, starts_with('Age'), starts_with('Time'), Value) %>% 
  as_tibble()


```
Now that we know what the data structure looks like, let's plot the 1990, 1995, and 1999 ASFR schedules for the two countries.

```{r make_plot}

# make a new data frame with the data of interest
df = df_data %>% 
      select(Country=Location, Year=TimeLabel,Age=AgeMid,ASFR=Value) %>% 
       filter(Year %in% c(1990,1995,1999))

# construct a plot

ggplot(data=df) +
  aes(x=Age, y=ASFR, group=Country, color=Country) +
  geom_line(lwd=2, alpha=.80) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,300,100),
                     minor_breaks = seq(0,300,50)) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=1)

```
